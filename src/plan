UnoCard and WildCard and FunctionCard, how should they be designed for modular
and Open Closed design.

It feels like we need to do instanceof. Maybe that should be the first step, replace enum with checks to
instance of. And then take it from there.

ActionCard has different strings for types. Could be replaced by enum, but it would still
not really make for Open Closed. Better would be that each actionCard is it's own class.

We could still have one class for all cards that should draw (just different amounts).

Then we can have UnoCard, WildCard
