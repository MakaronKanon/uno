# UNO project rework
The original code does not belong to me, someone else wrote it.
 
I have analyzed the original code-base from an object-oriented perspective 
in an object-orientation course at Chalmers.
I felt I could not just leave this code without fixing
 the things i analyzed were bad.

To build it and try it you should open the project in intellij.
I have not bothered to try anything else but  
you can probably open it in anything else or just build it from command-line.

To see the difference between before and after, you need to compare this repo vs the repo i forked from
https://github.com/tk-codes/uno

This project is a work in progress!
